DojoEnterpriseApp
-------

This application is an abstracted application framework for large web applications that use the Dojo toolkit (www.dojotoolkit.org).

The main features are:

1) Abstracted control layer with:
a. abstracted communications protocols so that 'real' servers can be mocked during unit tests.
b. abstracted server calls to introduce clean separation of concerns so that code is not littered with Urls and thus easier to refactor.
c. provides a central location to perform work on all server calls (such as applying security policies, auditing, url resolution etc).

2) Common set of application widgets:
a. _Widget base class that provides life-cycle management.
b. a full-page container widget with plugins for common 'enterprise' features such as session management.
